 Hiiii, Read the menu. Enjoy it. We are designing the menu card for a Restaurant. It is the first menu card we are designing. HTML & CSS are used for writing the structure and adding the style to it. We are designing it for the very first time. Hope, you all will like it. Trying me level best for the same. Let's work hard and make it as good as possible. Name of the Hotel and Menu card is still to be decided. I hope you people like it. Feedbacks are most welcomed.</p></section></div>
